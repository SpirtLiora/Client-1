project information

first thoughts: 

1. Fast, most graphically powerful 2 computer.
2.Lots of space on the computers.
3.a couple of external hard drives would also prove useful.
4.Wacom tablet, and the best audio system you can find.
5.prefer Windows, but if we were to take on Linux, it would have to be a user-friendly distribution.
6.need a new network printer, just something to print off black and white copies of our work, as we get our colour prints done professionally off-site.
